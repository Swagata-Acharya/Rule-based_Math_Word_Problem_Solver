# Rule-based_Math_Word_Problem_Solver
In this work, we present an approach to solve arithmetic word problems automatically. However, it is limited to solve only single operation and single equation word problems. We used a rule-based approach in classifying word problems. We proposes various rules to establish the relationships and dependencies among various key-entities to broadly classify the word problems into four categories (Change, Combine, Compare and Division-Multiplication) and their sub-categories to identify the desired operation among+, -, *, and /. Irrelevant information is also filtered out from input problem texts, based on hand-crafted rules to extract relevant quantities. Later, an equation is formed with the relevant quantities and predicted operation to generate the final answer. The work proposed here, performs well as compared to most of the similar systems on the standard SingleOp dataset & achieve an accuracy of 93.02%.
